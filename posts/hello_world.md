This is my first blog post!

Recently, I received a new Thinkpad neo 14 (Intel version) from my supervisor.
Suffering from setting up a development environment on Windows, I installed Arch
Linux and noted down my setup steps.

Taking notes wasn't a big thing, but I had no idea how to share my notes. At
first, I was about to build a beautiful PDF document with LaTeX but soon
realized that it wouldn't be light work to manually convert a Markdown file of
several hundreds of lines to a LaTeX file. Then, I tried to post my notes on
social media. However, I didn't find any platform on which I would be willing to
write something.

Finally, I started this simple website to post my notes and thoughts. I chose
Deno Blog as I wanted to try Deno stuffs since I knew the Deno project. I also
found that, compared to Node stuff, Deno Blog is easy to set up and deploy.

That is why I started to write blog posts and deployed such a website, and so my
next blog post is about my steps to install Arch Linux on a laptop.
